#Decision Tree Classifier to Predict Customer Purchases
-This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. 
-The model is trained using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
-The dataset includes information such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, and more.

#Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product (e.g., a bank's term deposit) based on various demographic and behavioral features. We use the Decision Tree Classifier from the scikit-learn library to build the model, and evaluate it using metrics like accuracy.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 45,521 instances and 17 features, including customer demographic information and the outcome of previous marketing campaigns.

#Features
-age: Age of the customer
-job: Type of job (e.g., admin, technician, etc.)
-marital: Marital status
-education: Education level
-default: Whether the customer has credit in default
-balance: Customer's account balance
-housing: Whether the customer has a housing loan
-loan: Whether the customer has a personal loan
-contact: Communication type used to contact the customer
-day: Last contact day of the month
-month: Last contact month of the year
-duration: Duration of the last contact
-campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign
-pdays: Number of days since the customer was last contacted
-previous: Number of contacts performed before this campaign
-poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign
-y: Whether the customer subscribed to the product (target variable)

#Installation

-Clone the repository:
-Install the dependencies using requirements.txt:

#Usage
-Load the dataset and preprocess it.
-Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
-Train a Decision Tree model on the training set.
-Evaluate the model using accuracy and other metrics.
-Optionally, perform hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.

#Model Evaluation
-After training the model, we evaluate its performance using the following metrics:
-Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions.
-Confusion Matrix: A matrix to evaluate the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
-Classification Report: A detailed report including precision, recall, and F1-score.

#Hyperparameter Tuning
To improve the model's performance, we can perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the optimal values for hyperparameters such as max_depth, min_samples_split, etc.

#Conclusion
-This project demonstrates how to build a Decision Tree Classifier for predicting customer purchases. We have explored data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
-By implementing hyperparameter tuning, the model's performance can be improved, leading to more accurate predictions.
